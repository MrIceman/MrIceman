### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with a great team on an online gaming competition platform. My focus is on the backend
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more system level projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with low level Code
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Software Architecture, Software Engineering, Backend / Mobile Development, Kotlin, Go, Django / Flask, Flutter, Android Native, React Native, Testing
- ðŸ’» I speak Go, Python, Kotlin, Java, Dart, JavaScript, TypeScript and C (though I very rarely use it). Hope to do more with Rust in future
