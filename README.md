### Hi there 👋

## What do I work with professionally?
- 👅 Languages: Go, Kotlin, Python, Dart
- 🚒 Infrastructure: AWS (I ❤️ Serverless), Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker 
- 🌟 Specialization: Backend, DevOps / Cloud
- 👴 Previously: Mobile developer

I'm an enthusiastic software engineer who always has side projects going on. 
In my free time I enjoy writing Apps in Flutter (previously I developed for almost a decade android apps, professionally).
I like reading books about programming (mostly theoretical books).
Another hobby of mine is experimenting with languages, I've wrote some stuff in Rust and the next language I want to explore is Haskell. 

As an enthusiast of OO and software architecture & design,
I think the domain of functional programming deserves more attention. Writing truly declarative code (not only for the UI of your clients, but for the whole system) is an interesting concept.
