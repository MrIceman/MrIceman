I'm an enthusiastic software engineer who always has side projects going on. I like reading books about programming (mostly theoretical books).
Another hobby of mine is experimenting with languages, I've wrote some stuff in Rust and the next language I want to explore is Haskell. 

As an enthusiast of OO and software architecture & design,
I think the domain of functional programming deserves more attention. Writing truly declarative code (not only for the UI of your clients, but for the whole system) is an interesting concept.
