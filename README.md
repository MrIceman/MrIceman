### Hi there 👋


## Who are the heck are you?
My name is Martin, I live in Germany and I was born on June 18th, 1993 in Hannover

- 👅 Languages I mainly work with: Go, Kotlin, Python, Dart, Java
- 🚒 Infrastructure: AWS (I ❤️ Serverless), Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker 
- 🌟 Specialization: Backend, DevOps / Cloud
- 👴 Previously: Mobile developer

- 🥰 I'm an enthusiastic software engineer who always has side projects going on.
- 💙 In my free time I enjoy writing Apps in Flutter (previously I developed for almost a decade android apps, professionally).
- 📚 I like reading books about programming (mostly theoretical books).
- ⛹️‍♂️ Another hobby of mine is experimenting with languages, I've wrote some stuff in Rust and think it's a great language, though at this point my 
language of choice is Go. Nothing beats its simplicity, compile and build times. 

**My latest thoughts about programming**
- When I was a green horn, my first programming language I dedicated myself to was Java and I started studying OO concepts and software architecture & design,
which is an experience that shifted me until this day, but lo and behold, today I think the domain of functional programming deserves more attention. 
Writing truly declarative code  is an interesting concept I wish to explore further (not only for the UI of your clients, but for the whole system).
I would like to see how it is to not write imperative code with mutable state updates, but have a formally provable code that consists of events, immutable state
and functions that transform state.
